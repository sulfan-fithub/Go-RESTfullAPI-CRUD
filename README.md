Creating a README.md file for your GitHub project is a great way to provide information and instructions for potential users and contributors. Here's a template you can use for your Go RESTful API CRUD project:

```markdown
# Go RESTful API CRUD

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) RESTful API written in Go. It allows you to perform basic CRUD operations on a collection of resources. This project is a great starting point for building more complex APIs or as a learning resource for Go developers.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources.
- Data is stored in-memory, making it easy to get started without setting up a database.
- RESTful API design principles.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Go (at least Go 1.11)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sulfan-fithub/Go-RESTfullAPI-CRUD.git
   cd Go-RESTfullAPI-CRUD
   ```

2. Build and run the project:

   ```bash
   go build
   ./Go-RESTfullAPI-CRUD
   ```

By default, the API server will run on port 8080. You can change this in the `config/config.go` file.

## Usage

You can interact with the API using HTTP requests. You can use a tool like [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the API.

## API Endpoints

Here are the available API endpoints:

- `GET /api/resources`: Get a list of all resources.
- `GET /api/resources/{id}`: Get a specific resource by ID.
- `POST /api/resources`: Create a new resource.
- `PUT /api/resources/{id}`: Update a resource by ID.
- `DELETE /api/resources/{id}`: Delete a resource by ID.

For detailed usage and request/response examples, refer to the [API documentation](API_DOCUMENTATION.md).
